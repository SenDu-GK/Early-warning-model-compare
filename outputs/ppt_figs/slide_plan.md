# Slide Plan (8 slides)

## Slide 1: Title + Objective
Talk track: Introduce the early-warning task, location, and high-level goal of risk rising near failure.

## Slide 2: Data & Spatial Labeling
Talk track: Describe InSAR points, landslide polygon, and near/far negative definitions.

## Slide 3: Task Definitions
Talk track: Summarize three paradigms (leadtime classification, survival hazard, forecast anomaly) and shared risk_pk outputs.

## Slide 4: Training/Validation Design
Talk track: Emphasize point-id splits, shared split file, and no leakage across runs.

## Slide 5: Metrics Overview
Talk track: Explain AUC-over-time, lead-time thresholding, FAR calibration, and trend statistics.

## Slide 6: Task Comparison (FigA + FigC)
Talk track: Compare AUC by task/variant; highlight leadtime trade-offs and where best leadtime run sits.

## Slide 7: Best Run Curves + Trend Significance (FigE + FigD)
Talk track: Show mean-risk and AUC curves for the best run; interpret trend p-values for temporal strengthening.

## Slide 8: Risk Map Montage (FigF)
Talk track: Show early/mid/late risk maps for the best run; discuss spatial concentration near failure.
